 The code runs different planets rotating around a central sun.


## Overview:
The code runs different planets rotating around a central sun. The primary control is the mouse. 
Left click to move the astronaut away from the space ship. Left clicking also selects a new position
for comets to fly from. I chose the solar system because it allowed me to be creative without over tasking myself.

## Challenging:
I found coding the comets direction very difficult, it would fly off the screen and not re-iterate so i had to write and if statement clause to help with repeating the previous comets code. Also i wanted to create ellipse rotations but i was unable to do that, but I was able to create cool motions for a moon, as you can see it rotating twice around a planet.

## What went well:
I was able to achieve the desired look i was going for. The comet was also the most exciting part for me, and having it reiterate from the position where the mouse clicks went very well.
